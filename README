Audisp-cef
----------


This program is a plugin for Linux Audit user space programs available at <http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/audit/>.
It uses the audisp multiplexer.

Audisp-cef correlates messages coming from the kernel's audit (and through audisp) into a single CEF message through syslog.
CEF stands for Common Event Format.
