Audisp-cef
----------


This program is a plugin for Linux Audit user space programs available at <http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/audit/>.
It uses the audisp multiplexer.

Audisp-cef correlates messages coming from the kernel's audit (and through audisp) into a single CEF message through syslog.
CEF stands for Common Event Format.

Required dependencies:
- Audit (2.0+)

For package building:

Example for rsyslog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We're assuming you're logging auditd stuff to LOCAL5 here. Replace <SYSLOG_SERVER_IP_HERE> by your syslogger.
Due to the nature/sensitivity of the logs, using TLS as transport is highly recommended.

#Drop native audit messages from the kernel (may happen is auditd dies, and may kill the system otherwise)
:msg, regex, "type=[0-9]* audit" ~
#Sent audit rate limit errors directly to the remote syslog server
:msg, contains, "rate limit exceeded" @<SYSLOG_SERVER_IP_HERE>
:msg, contains, "audit_lost=" @<SYSLOG_SERVER_IP_HERE>
#Drop audit sid msg (work-around until RH fixes the kernel - should be fixed in RHEL7 and recent RHEL6)
:msg, contains, "error converting sid to string" ~

#Don't log auditd messages to disk, we're logging way too much stuff for that
*.info;local5.none			/var/log/messages
#Log remotely instead
local5.*					@<SYSLOG_SERVER_IP_HERE>
